# Documentation

Welcome to the Karate Xplorer documentation. If you're familiar with Postman, you'll be productive immediately—no learning curve required.

![Karate Xplorer Interface]({{ '/assets/images/docs/xplorer-ui.png' | relative_url }})

## Overview

Karate Xplorer is a desktop application that runs Postman collections and environments locally. It provides:

- **100% Local - Zero Cloud**: Your API keys, tokens, and secrets never leave your machine—no risk of cloud data leakage
- **Zero Migration Effort**: Run existing collections as-is, no changes needed
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Pass/fail indicators in navigation tree and detailed output pane
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Run collections with CSV or JSON data files
- **Enterprise Ready**: Signed desktop application for macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Key Differentiators

### Superior Test Feedback
Unlike Postman, Karate Xplorer shows pass/fail indicators directly in the navigation tree, making it easy to see test results at a glance. The output pane provides detailed HTML reports with assertion details.

### Data-Driven Testing
Easily run collections with different data sets using the CSV/JSON tab. Perfect for testing multiple scenarios without duplicating requests.

### cURL Import
Quickly convert cURL commands to requests using the Import pane. Great for adding examples from API documentation.

### Simple Environment Handling
One active environment at a time keeps things simple and predictable. Environment variables are displayed in the Environment pane and update in real-time during execution.
